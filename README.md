There's no strict rules at training, but make sure your homework format is correct for the TAs will run your code through automatic program.

If you want to use different way from the ml2022_hw2.ipynb to train , you can later test your model by using 


# model = torch.load("./model.pth")

# model.to(device)

we will only check from this part.

The minimum accuracy is required to be 60.19%, as for it's a really trivial way to do with resnet50.

In your report, you should show your accuracy and explained what you have done to improve your model, training tricks...

You can make your own model(which is strongly recommended for all the postgraduates) , or using the off-the shelf model.

Good Luck!
